A React-based web application to control volume-related notifications using Philips Hue lights via IFTTT triggers.

## Use Case

In a shared office environment, noise levels can sometimes become disruptive. This app allows employees to use Philips Hue lights (via IFTTT) to visually signal the current noise level to their colleagues:

- **Red Light**: "Really Too Loud!" â€“ Indicates that the noise level is unacceptable and needs immediate attention.
- **Yellow Light**: "Too Loud!" â€“ A warning that the noise level is becoming disruptive.
- **Green Light**: "Fine" â€“ Indicates that the noise level is acceptable.

This system helps maintain a productive and respectful office atmosphere.
